# Bocchio's WebSite

My personal website: an online laboratory that helps me talk about the projects I have done, in some cases build new ones and generally experiment.

## Discovering new stuff

I have used this project over the last few months as an online lab where I could discover some new techniques and take a look at the unknown world of javascript, frameworks, basic HTML, CSS and so on.

Started just for fun, it quickly became a full website with user registration, database, analytics, forum, integrated WebApp and some other cool features.

Sometimes I preferred to avoid using ready-made libraries just to have a more complete view on how to manage particular web-related tasks (like cookies or loggin system).

Many commits, many tests, many fails... but that's how I thought of it in my head

## Links and resources

The whole project is divided into two different repositories, one for the "frontend" and another for the "backend/database". The database is also hosted on a different domain/host.

Links to the repositories:

- [Frontend](https://github.com/Bocchio01/Bocchio_WebSite) (Nuxt/VueJS framework, HTML and CSS)
- [Backend/Database](https://github.com/Bocchio01/Bocchio_WebSite_Utils) (PHP and MySQL)

Links to sites:

- [Main website](https://bocchio.netlify.app) (hosted on Netlify)
- [Analytics/Database](https://bocchioutils.altervista.org) (hosted on Altervista)
